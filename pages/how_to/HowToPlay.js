        <Text style={styles.sectionInfo}>We understand that different players may have varying preferences for the level of competition they seek. Therefore, we provide the option to disable deductions, allowing for a less competitive experience.
         By disabling deductions, players can enjoy the game without the worry of losing points for incorrect answers. This feature creates a more relaxed and casual atmosphere, emphasizing participation, learning, and fun rather than the competitive aspect of scoring.
         Whether you're looking for a friendly trivia gathering or a low-pressure learning experience, disabling deductions offers flexibility and customization to match your desired style of play. It ensures that everyone can enjoy the game at their own pace and comfort level, fostering a more inclusive and enjoyable Jeopardy experience for all participants.</Text>
